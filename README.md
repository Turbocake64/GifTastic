# GifTastic

Overview:

This webpage should dynamically create buttons that will ping information from the gify API to bring up 9 gifs related to the cartoon labeled on the butto. Additionally, you can write a new cartoon (or anything actually) into the form and that will create an additional button that brings up 9 gifs and the rating related to that topic.

Each gif will be a still until the image is clicked on, where it will play the actual gif. If you click it again it will revert back to the still (not actually stop.)

Code used:

HTML
Javascript:
    jquery
    ajax
    
Reflection: 

in contrast to my last assignment, I wanted to focus on the back end and the dynamically created html elements before anything else. We went over most of the js, jquery, and ajax in class so I wanted to focus on really understanding how each piece works, how scope affects their function, and understanding how a dynamically generated element could be manipulated with styles after the fact. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to actually add any styings, so maybe that can be something I come back to later.
